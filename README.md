# Bubble Adventure

Bubble Adventure is a fun and nostalgic game inspired by the classic title *Bubble Bobble*. Originally created in 2014, it has been brought to life once again and updated to run on the latest version of *Unity (2023.3.9f1)*.

Please note that Bubble Adventure is currently playable but is in an incomplete state. It was moved into this repository as it was gathering dust on my machine.
